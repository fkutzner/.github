## Welcome to the IPASIR 2 Workgroup!

This GitHub space exists for bringing together the users and developers of incremental SAT solvers for discussing the details of the next version of the _Re-entrant Incremental SAT solver API_  (IPASIR). 

IPASIR was proposed in SAT Race 2015 [1]. 
It became the standard interface for evaluating the performance of incremental SAT solvers in the annual international SAT competitions.
Today, many applications of incremental SAT solvers can use IPASIR solvers.

However, IPASIR has some limitations.
Symptomatic for these limitations are the multitude of proposed features coming from the community of users and developers of incremental SAT solvers.
This proposition is a culmination of all these ideas which have been floating around.
The draft shall serve as a foundation for further discussions.

The reverse acronym IPASIR is pronounced as in "IPA, Sir?".
With this proposal we ambitiously and consequently "make it two".
