## Welcome to the IPASIR 2 Workgroup!

This GitHub space exists for bringing together the users and developers of incremental SAT solvers for discussing the details of the next version of the Re-entrant Incremental SAT solver API (IPASIR). 
Several ideas for extending IPASIR have been proposed, addressing issues and limitations of the existing IPASIR. 
I collected and organized these ideas which have been floating around on GitHub, in my Mailbox, or other sources. 
This culminated in some initial weighting and discussions about IPASIR-2.
The resulting draft shall serve as a foundation for further discussions.

The reverse acronym IPASIR is pronounced as in "IPA, Sir?".
With this proposal we "make it two".
