## Welcome to the IPASIR 2 Workgroup!

This GitHub space exists for bringing together the users and developers of incremental SAT solvers for discussing the details of the next version of the Re-entrant Incremental SAT solver API (IPASIR). 
Several ideas for extending IPASIR have been proposed, addressing issues and limitations of the existing IPASIR. 
I collected and organized these ideas which have been floating around on GitHub, in my Mailbox, or other sources. 
This culminated in some initial weighting and discussions about IPASIR-2.
The resulting draft shall serve as a foundation for further discussions.

The reverse acronym IPASIR is pronounced as "IPA, Sir?" to honour all the barkeepers who have offered us an Indian Pale Ale (IPA).
The gentleman with a glas of IPA became an inoffical IPASIR mascot - the real IPA-Sir.
In the title image of this workgroup, the IPA-Sir holds already two IPA to indicate the version increment coming with IPASIR-2.
